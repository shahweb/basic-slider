1. 
Loops are great when you want to do the same task/run the same code over and over again, and each time with a different value.


2.
for(initialization; condition; final-expression) {
    statement
}

for (step 1; step 2; step 3) {
    // code block to be executed
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(`Hello World`);
}

3.
The for loop loops through a block of code a specified number of times.

4.
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(`Hello World`);
}

this loop runs 5 times. We get 5 Hello world messages.
this loop  will executed as long as i < 5 is true, the statement will logged on console.

5. for block ({})

6.
After the code block has been executed, the program returns to step 2 aka condition

7.
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i == 6) {
    break;
  }
}

8.

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
   continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
